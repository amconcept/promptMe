KEYBOARD CONTROLS ENHANCEMENT (LATEST UPDATE)
==============================================
- Changed Up Arrow key to generate prompts (same functionality as Enter key)
- Up Arrow now triggers prompt generation instead of blurring input field
- Both Up Arrow and Enter can be used to run/generate prompts
- Added on-screen keyboard instruction display on prompting page

- Instructions displayed at bottom center of screen when showInstructions is true
- Clear visual guidance for users on keyboard controls
- Updated keyPressed() function comments to reflect new Up Arrow behavior
- Enhanced user experience with intuitive keyboard navigation
- All arrow keys work consistently whether input field is focused or not

NAME VALIDATION & KEYBOARD IMPROVEMENTS (LATEST UPDATE)
========================================================
- Added name validation requirement before prompt generation
- Prompt generation now blocked if no student name is entered
- Error beep sound (200Hz, 150ms) plays when attempting to generate without a name
- Name validation checks studentName, previousName, and input field value
- Validation applied to both Up Arrow and Enter key handlers
- Fixed Up Arrow handler to properly read from p5.js input element (primary source)
- Up Arrow now correctly validates name from p5.js input before generating prompts
- Down Arrow now clears name field when pressed (clears both p5.js and DOM inputs)
- Down Arrow clears studentName and previousName variables on press
- Down Arrow focuses input field after clearing for immediate name entry
- Enhanced name validation logic to check multiple sources (p5.js input, DOM input, variables)
- Improved user experience with clear feedback when name is required
- Prevents accidental prompt generation without student identification

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (SUGGESTED)
===============================
- Advanced constraint options
- Animation improvements
- Mobile responsiveness
- User preferences panel
- Multi-language support
- Cloud storage integration

TECHNICAL STACK
===============
- HTML5/CSS3 for structure and styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for logic
- P5.js for creative coding and graphics
- Local Storage for data persistence
- Responsive design principles

MODULAR ARCHITECTURE (Version 2025.2)
=====================================
Sketch Modules:
- sketch-refactored.js: Main orchestrator (836 lines)
- ui-manager.js: UI elements and interactions (671 lines)
- animation-manager.js: Animations & sound effects (204 lines)
- data-manager.js: Data persistence (724 lines)
- student-manager.js: Student navigation (96 lines)
- prompt-generator.js: Prompt generation logic (331 lines)

Editor Modules:
- editor-main.js: Main orchestrator (342 lines)
- theme-manager.js: Theme switching (279 lines)
- editor-ui-manager.js: UI elements & forms (626 lines)

Benefits:
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each module has one clear purpose
- Easier debugging: Locate issues in specific modules
- Better collaboration: Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- Improved maintainability: Clear code organization
- Scalability: Easy to add new features without touching existing code

RECENT UPDATES (Version 2025.2)
================================
- Changed 'A' key to UP ARROW for generating prompts in sketch
- Fixed missing prompts and categories in editor initialization
- Corrected syntax errors in editor modules
- Updated file structure to reflect modular architecture

CATEGORY SELECTION FIXES (LATEST UPDATE)
==========================================
- Fixed critical bug where category selections were not being saved when individual checkboxes were clicked
- Root cause: "All Categories" checkbox was not being found by document.getElementById() because ID was only set on p5.js element, not DOM element
- Fixed by setting checkbox ID on both p5.js element and DOM element in ui-manager.js
- Improved clearing logic in populateInterestCheckboxes() to properly preserve "All Categories" checkbox during category updates
- Enhanced checkbox state reading to use both p5.js attribute() method and DOM getAttribute() for reliability
- Added setTimeout delay before calling updateInterestSelection() to ensure checkbox state is fully updated
- Fixed stopAnimation error by changing export to clearAnimations (correct function name)
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout category selection flow for troubleshooting
- Category selections now properly persist and filter prompts correctly when individual categories are selected
- Fixed issue where selectedCategory was not staying consistent across all prompts in a generation
- Enhanced category filtering logic to ensure selected category exists in ALL prompt types before selection
- Added validation to prevent category switching during prompt generation

UI CONSISTENCY & DEFAULT STATE FIXES (LATEST UPDATE)
====================================================
- Removed all hardcoded category label defaults (sport, entertainment, academic, creative)
- Category labels now start empty when editor opens with new/default state
- Fixed initializeDefaultState() to explicitly reset criterionLabels to empty array
- Updated CSV import function to use empty defaults instead of hardcoded values
- Editor now starts completely clean with no pre-populated category labels
- Fixed prompt text size inconsistency when navigating between students
- Recalled prompts now use same text size (0.05) as animated prompts to prevent enlargement
- Prevents text from appearing larger when navigating with left/right arrows
- Changed all [X] delete buttons from red (#FF6B6B) to theme color
- Delete buttons now match selected theme (green, orange, blue, purple, pink, white, black)
- Updated all theme definitions to set --delete-color to match --primary-color
- Consistent visual appearance with delete buttons using theme color throughout interface
- Updated CSS to use var(--primary-color) instead of var(--delete-color) for delete buttons
- All delete buttons (.delete-category, .delete-prompt, .settings-item-delete) now use theme color

This changelog represents the complete development history and current feature set of the PromptMe App as of January 2025.
