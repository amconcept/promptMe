## What is PromptMe?

PromptMe is a web-based application that helps teachers create structured, randomized prompts for students. Think of it as a digital prompt generator that ensures every student gets unique, varied combinations of ideas to work with—perfect for creative projects, design challenges, artistic exercises, or any activity where you want to provide structured inspiration.

## Why is PromptMe Cool?

### 🎯 **Structured Creativity**
Instead of giving students a blank page and endless possibility, PromptMe provides organized categories of prompts that work together. For example, a design project might combine:
- **Category A**: Different materials (wood, fabric, metal)
- **Category B**: Different functions (storage, seating, lighting)
- **Category C**: Different styles (modern, vintage, minimalist)

Each student gets a unique combination, ensuring variety while maintaining structure and focusing on the skills teachers want to develop. This allows teachers to provide customized experiences for diverse learners, including options that incorporate student interests. The system helps avoid repetition and copying while encouraging differentiation, making activities more challenging, customizable, and engaging.

### 🎲 **Smart Randomization**
The app automatically prevents repetition, so students won't get the same prompts until all options have been used. This means every student gets fresh, unique combinations without you having to manually track what's been used.

### 📊 **Easy Organization**
Upload your class list once, and the app tracks which students have received prompts. Navigate between students easily, take screenshots of their results, and download a complete class report at any time.

### 🎨 **Visual Appeal**
The prompting interface features a retro terminal aesthetic with smooth animations that make the experience engaging and fun. Students watch as their prompts reveal themselves in an exciting, game-like way.

### 💾 **Save and Share**
Create activity templates and save them for future use. Share your prompt sets with other teachers via CSV files. Everything is stored locally in your browser, so your data stays private.

## What Can PromptMe Be Used For?

### **Design Projects**
Create design challenges where students combine different materials, functions, and constraints. Perfect for architecture, product design, or art classes.

**Example**: "Design an object to think with that combines [Material] + [Function] + [Style]"

### **Creative Writing**
Generate story prompts with different characters, settings, and plot elements. Each student gets a unique combination to spark their imagination.

**Example**: "[Character Type] + [Setting] + [Conflict] = Unique Story Prompt"

### **Problem-Solving Challenges**
Set up engineering or math challenges with varying constraints and requirements. Students work with different parameters while solving the same type of problem.

### **Language Learning**
Create vocabulary exercises where students combine different words, contexts, and grammar structures.

### **Any Structured Activity**
If you have categories of options that need to be combined in different ways, PromptMe can help you randomize and track them efficiently.

## How Does It Work?

PromptMe has two main parts:

### 1. **The Editor** (Where You Set Up Prompts)
This is where you design your activity:

- **Create Categories**: Set up rows (A, B, C, D) that represent different types of options
- **Add Prompt Columns**: Create columns (Prompt 1, 2, 3, 4) that represent different characteristics or requirements
- **Fill in Options**: Add specific items to each category. For example, Category A might have "wood, metal, fabric" while Category B has "storage, seating, lighting"
- **Set an Objective**: Write what students should create or accomplish
- **Save Your Activity**: Give it a name and save it for future use

**Think of it like a grid**: Rows are categories, columns are prompt types, and each cell contains specific options.

### 2. **The Prompting Interface** (Where Students Get Prompts)
This is where the magic happens:

- **Enter Student Name**: Type or select a student's name
- **Generate Prompts**: Press the Up Arrow or Enter key to generate a unique combination
- **Watch the Animation**: Prompts reveal themselves with a fun scrambling animation
- **Navigate Students**: Use Left/Right arrows to move between students
- **Track Progress**: The app remembers what each student received

**The Result**: Each student gets one item from each category, creating a unique combination like "wood + storage + modern" or "fabric + seating + vintage".
